# üåå Enhanced 3D Spatial Air Conductor

An advanced hand-tracking music composition system that creates music in real-time using 3D hand movements. This enhanced version features spatial audio zones, advanced particle visualization, and immersive 3D effects.

## ‚ú® New 3D Features

### üéØ Spatial Music Zones
The 3D space is divided into different musical zones, each with unique instruments and effects:

- **Upper Zones (Ethereal)**: Harp & Flute with reverb effects
- **Middle Zones (Melodic)**: Piano & Violin with chorus/delay effects  
- **Lower Zones (Rhythmic)**: Drums & Bass with distortion/filter effects
- **Center Zone (Harmonic)**: Choir with chorus effects for harmony control

### üé® Advanced Particle System
- **Note Particles**: Colorful particles that appear when playing instruments
- **Trail Particles**: Follow hand movements with velocity-based effects
- **Harmony Particles**: Special effects when hands create harmonic resonance
- **Zone Particles**: Visual feedback when entering spatial zones
- **Frequency Visualization**: Real-time audio frequency visualization

### üéµ 3D Audio Features
- **Spatial Positioning**: Hand position affects stereo panning and depth
- **Depth Effects**: Z-axis controls reverb, delay, and filtering
- **Hand Distance**: Distance between hands affects chorus and harmony
- **Velocity Mapping**: Hand speed controls volume and dynamics
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Synchronized hand movements create harmonic overtones

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Grant Camera Permission**: Allow webcam access for hand tracking
2. **Position Hands**: Hold hands in front of camera with palms facing forward
3. **Explore Zones**: Move hands through different areas to discover instruments
4. **Toggle 3D Mode**: Press 'D' to experience enhanced spatial audio
5. **Experiment**: Try different hand positions, speeds, and combinations

## üì± Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge: Full support with optimal performance
- Firefox: Supported with minor performance differences
- Safari: Supported (may require camera permission setup)

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

- Use Chrome for best performance
- Ensure good lighting for hand tracking
